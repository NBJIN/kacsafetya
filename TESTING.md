### Flake 8 Report 

While running the flake8 report there was a number of items raised in relation to files that the django project generated itself and not coded by the developer.  These files were:
- ./.vscode/arctictern.py 
- ./.vscode/make_url.py
- ./basket/migrations/
- ./contact/migrations
- ./courses/migrations
- ./dashboard/migrations
- ./mailchimpnews/migrations
- ./purchase/migrations


Files which were coded by the developer and are showing up on the flake8
report are below.  


- ./courses/views.py - Had to leave this in as it was affecting the operation of code.  
- ./env.py - tried making these lines of code shorter but it 
was presented errors in the terminal.  
- ./kac_safety/settings.py -  have to leave env in as when i took this out it was presenting an error with the secret key.   
- /kac_safety/settings.py - Again when i went to shorten these
lines of code it presented errors in the terminal.
- ./purchase/apps - had to leave the purchase signals in as without it was causing issues in code.
