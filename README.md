### SEO – Search Engine Optimisation
#### A sitemap.xml has been included in the root directory of this project.  This will aid search engine crawlers discover and crawl all of the pages on the ecommerce site including those that may be difficult to find through normal navigation or links.  A robots.txt file is also included in the root directory of this project.  This will instruct search engine crawlers which pages or sections of the website should not be crawled or indexed.  

## Surface 
### Design Choice 
#### Bootstrap has been used to aid responsiveness of the site 

### Color Schema 
#### The color scheme used on this site is mainly a shade of grey and red.  It allows the content to be shown clearly on the page and in the context of health and safety red is commonly used for warning signs, fire alarms and hazardous material etc to alert people of potential danger and the need for caution.  
#### 
https://mycolor.space/ was used to research these color types.

#### Red Ral Color #CC0000

## Deployment 
With a fully working django ecommerce project the final steps to hosting the project are as follows:
#### •	First the database is created and this will be completed by using ElephantSQL
1.	Set up an account with ElephantSQL if you don’t have one already else login to your account.  
2.	Access the dashboard on ElephantSQL and click on the button ‘Create New Instance’.
3.	Then set up your plan by giving your plan a ‘Name’ this is usually the name of the project, then select ‘Tiny Turtle (Free) plan’ and then leave the ‘Tags’ field blank.
4.	Next Select “Select Region”
5.	Select a data center near you in this case ‘EU-West-1----’
6.	Then click on ‘Review’
7.	Review your detail again and ensure they are correct then click on ‘Create Instance’
8.	Go to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the ‘database instance name’ for the project
9.	Under Details in the section of this page click on copy icon at the right of the url 
10.	Leaving this for a moment we need to create a new database instance 
#### •	Next we will create the Heroku app 
1.	Again if a new user set up and account with Heroku or if you have an account already log in with credentials.
2.	Then click on ‘New’ to create a new app.
3.	Give your app a name and select the region closest to you 
4.	Then click ‘Create app’
5.	Open the ‘settings’ tab in Heroku 
6.	Click on ‘reveal config vars’
7.	Then add the config var ‘DATABASE_URL’ and then paste in the url which would have been copied from ElephantSQL. 
#### •	With the database created in ElephantSQL and app created on Heroku revert back to code specifically to the settings.py file in the project folder in Gitpod (code anywhere if using this IDE) and we need to carry out the steps to connect the db to the local development web server.
1.	In the terminal of the projects Gitpod workspace install dj_database_url and psycopg2 by inserting the following command in the terminal: pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
2.	Update the requirements.txt file with the newly install packages by typing the following command in the terminal – pip freeze > requirements.txt
3.	In settings.py of the project folder import dj_database_url underneath the import os at the top of the page – import dj_database_url
4.	Proceed to the Database section in settings.py – need to comment out the code that is in this section and then enter code that will allow the connection to the new ElephantSQL database. Under the DATABASES commented out code add the following code – 
DATABASES = {
	‘default’: dj_database_url.parse(‘insert the datatbase url here from ElephantSQL’)
}
VERY IMPORTANT – Do not commit this file with your database string in the code this is just a temporary so that a connection can be made to the new database and make migrations.
5.	Back in the terminal run the showmigrations command – this will confirm if connection has been made to the external database.  Type the following command in the terminal – python3 manage.py showmigrations
6.	This will return a list of all migrations – none of these migrations will be checked off 
7.	Migrate the database models to the new database with the following command – python3 manage.py migrate.
8.	Create a superuser for the new database by tying the following command in the terminal – python3 manage.py createsuperuser – it will prompt to enter a username, email and password.  
9.	To prevent exposing the database when a push is done to Github remove the code in the database section in settings.py and set up the original code for sqlite database.  So in setting.py under the database section it should contain the following code:
DATABASES = {
     'default': {
         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
         'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
     }
 }
#### •	Now we need to confirm the database is set up
1.	In ElephantSQL page for your database in the left hand side of the page select ‘BROWSER’.
2.	Click the ‘Table queries’ button select ‘auth_user’
3.	Click ‘Execute’ and you will then see the newly created superuser details displayed which is confirmation that the tables have been created and data can be added.  
#### •	Referring back to the code in the Databases section of settings.py and in particular to counteract the exposing of variable we will add an if statement so that when the app is running on Heroku whet the database URL environment variable will be defined we connect to Postgres and otherwise we connect to SQLite.  
1.	In settings.py and above DATABASES we will add the following code –
 if ‘DATABASE_URL’ in os.environ:
	DATABASES = {
		‘default’: dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get(‘DATABASE_URL’))
}
else:
	DATABASES = {
		‘default’: {
			‘ENGINE’: ‘django.db.backends.sqlite3’,
			‘NAME’: os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ‘db.sqlite3’),
		}
	}
2.	Next we need to install gunicorn so in the terminal in gitpod type the following code – pip3 install gunicorn
3.	Then freeze the above into requirements file by typing the following in the terminal : pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
4.	Next create the Procfile in the root directory of the project which will tell Heroku to create a web dyno which will run gunicorn and server the django app.  In the Profile file type the following – web: gunicorn ‘name of app’.wsgi:application
5.	Next disable collect static so that Heroku wont start collecting static file when the project is deployed. In the terminal of the project in gitpod type the following command – Heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 –app ‘app name’.
6.	Add the hostname of the Heroku app to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py in section ALLOWED_HOSTS with the following code – ALLOWED_HOSTS = [‘name’.herokuapp.com’, ‘localhost’]
7.	Next deploy app by typing the following in the terminal -  ‘git add .’ then on the next line ‘git commit -m “name of commit”’ next line ‘git push’ and then finally on the next line  ‘git push Heroku main’
8.	Next type the following line in the termainal – Heroku git:remote -a ‘name of app’
9.	Return and type ‘git push Heroku main’ once you click on return this will print out a log with a link to the deployed app – when you open this link it will contain the deployed app
10.	Next set up automatic deploy in Heroku by clicking on ‘Deploy’ at the top of the screen then click ‘connect to GitHub’ 
11.	Click on ‘search’ to search for the repository once same has been selected click on ‘connect’.
12.	Now scroll down the page and click on ‘enable automatic deploys’ – this ensures that evey times we push to github our code will be deployed to Heroku also.
13.	Generate a secret key for Heroku.  There are many online sources but the source that I have used is ‘https://djecrety.ir/’
14.	Once you have generated the secret key add same to the config vars in Heroku –
SECRET_KEY = ‘paste in generated key from djecrety above’.
15.	Next go back to settings.py and replace the secret key with –
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(‘SECRET_KEY’, ‘’)
16.	Next set DEBUG = True only if there is a a development in the environment with the following line of code – DEBUG = ‘DEVELOPMENT’ in os.environ
17.	Then push changes to GitHub.
18.	You can go to Heroku and see the build log of the project and you can view same under ‘more view logs’.
19.	Once this process if finished you will see the link for the app and note saying it was successfully deployed to Heroku.  
#### •	Creating a AWS account – the site needs a place to store the static files and images for the site so we will use a cloud-based storage called Amazon Web Services s3 AWS for short.  
1.	Create a AWS account if you have not an account already else you can login by going to the following page https://aws.amazon.com/console/ and click on my account on the nav menu at the top of the page click on the dropdown and click on ‘AWS Management Console’.
2.	Once logged in you need to search of s3  under the services menu 
3.	When you navigate to the S3 page click on ‘create bucket’  and give it the same name as your Heroku app New we will create a bucket.
4.	Then you need to select a region and select the one that is closest to you.  
5.	Then you need to uncheck ‘Block all public access’
6.	Click on the tick box to acknowledge that the bucket will be public 
7.	Then click on ‘Create Bucket’ and this will bring you to the bucket list page
8.	Locate the bucket that you have just created click on it and  and you will be brought to the settings section
9.	Click on the properties tab and then click on ‘Static website hosting’ (which will give a new endpoint which can be used to access it from the internet) this will open a new dialog box called Static website hosting.  In the input box under Index document type ‘index.html’ and in the input box under Error document type ‘error.html’.  Then click on save.  
10.	Navigate to the permissions tab and then click on ‘CORS configuration’ (this will set up the required access between the Heroku app and this s3 bucket’

***** PUT IN TWO IMAGES 

Then click on Save

12.	Now navigate to the Bucket Policy tab and click on the ‘policy generator’ at the bottom of the screen so that we can create a security policy for this bucket.  
13.	This will bring you to the AWS Policy Generator Page where you will need to input some data.
14.	For step 1 Select Policy Type on this page select ‘S3 Bucket Policy’
15.	Under Step 2  Add Statements we want to allow all principles by adding a ‘*’ to the Principal input box.  For the Actions in this section select ‘Get Object’ from the dropdown menu.  Next you need to revert back to Permissions tab and then to Bucket Policy and  copy the Bucket policy editor ARN:  and paste it it to ‘Amazon Resource Name (ARN)’ input box in Setp 2 of the AWS Policy Generator page. Next click on ‘Add Statement’ .
16.	Unser Step 3 Generate Policy click on the ‘Generate Policy’ button.  A dialog box will open with the Policy JSON document copy the code in this dislog box and then go back to Permissions / Bucket Policy Tab and in the space provided under the heading Bucket policy editor ARN:  paste in the Policy JSON document code.  Add a ‘/*’ onto the end of the resouce key in your code. Finally click on ‘save’ on this page.   
17.	With the configuration for the Bucket Policy and CORS complete it will now allow full access to all resouces in the bucket.
18.	Then navigate to the ‘Acces Control List’ tab and under Public Access select the radio button for ‘Everyone’.  This will then open a diaglog box and click on the checkbox for ‘List object’ and then click on ‘Save’.
19.	Next we need to create a user to acces the bucket 
20.	In AWS got to the services menu open IAM 
21.	Naviage to ‘groups’ in the Dasboard at the left hand side of the screen 
22.	Then click on ‘Create New Group’ and give it a name Group Name : ‘Enter Name Here’ 
23.	Then click ‘Next’ and ‘Next’ again and then click on ‘Create Group’
24.	Next we need to create the policy to acess bucket.  Naviage to Polices on the left of the screen under Dashboard.
25.	Click on ‘create policy’ and naviage to the ‘JSON’ tab 
26.	Click on ‘import managed policy’ at the top of the dialog box 
27.	Then in the search box input ‘s3’ to search for same and then choose ‘AmazonS3FullAccess’ and click on ‘Import’
28.	We just want to allow access to the bucket so Navigate to ‘Services’ on the Nav bar at the top of the AWS page and on the left hand menu choose ‘s3’.  Here you will get the bucket ARN from the bucket policy page in s3
29.	Choose the ‘name of your bucket’ and navigate to ‘Permission’ and ‘Bucket Policy’ and copy the Bucket policy editor ARN: a the top of the large input box.  
30.	Then navigate back to ‘IAM Management Console’ to the ‘JSON’ file and paste the ‘ARN’ after Resoure in square brakets. Its inputted twice in double quotes and the second line has an extra ‘/*’ at the end which adds another rule for all files/folders in the bucket. 
31.	Then click on ‘Review Policy’ on this page 
32.	Give it a ‘Name’ and ‘Description’
33.	Then click on ‘Create Policy’
34.	This will then take the user back to the policy page and you will see a message at the top of the screen that ‘your policy name’ has been created. 
35.	Next attach the policy to the group that was created so navigate to ‘Groups’ under the ‘Dashboard’ then find your group ‘mange-yourgroupname’ and click on ‘attach policy’ then search for the policy that was just created and select it. Click on the tick box next to your policy and then click on ‘Attach Policy’.
36.	Now create a user to put in the group – navigate to ‘users’ on the dashboard and click on ‘add user’.
37.	Then create a ‘user name’ and give the user ‘programmatic access’ and then click on ‘next’. 
38.	Under Add user to group click on the ‘policy for the project’  to attach to the user and then click on ‘next tags’ then ‘next review’ and then click ‘create user’.
39.	This will bring you to the page where there is a success message to say you have successfully created the users shown on this page.
40.	We need to download the csv file on that page as it contain the users access key and secret access key which will be used to authenticate the user from the django app. V.I This file can only be downloaded once and should be completed at this stage.  
#### •	Connect Django to s3
1.	To connect Django to s3  we need to install two packages boto3 and django-storages
2.	Back in our project in Gitpod type the following command in the termianl to install boto3 – pip3 install boto3
3.	And to install django-storages type the following command in the terminal – pip3 install django-storages
4.	Now we need to freeze these requirements so in the teminal type the following command – pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
5.	Then add storages to installed apps in settings.py of your project
6.	We need to add settings to settings.py to connect django to s3 to tell it which bucket it should be communicating with.
7.	Under the media root code we will add an if statement –
If ‘USE_AWS’ in os.environ:
	AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = ‘insert bucket name here’
	AWS_s3_REGION_NAME = ‘enter region name’
	AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get(‘AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID’)
	AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get(‘AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY’)
8.	Now we need to go to Heroku and add aws keys to config variables in the deploy section 

## Github
-	Login to GitHub and create your new repository 
-	Go to the Repositories tab click on New 
-	Then enter the name of the repository you wish to create 
-	Click on create repository 
-	New repository is now ready to use 

## Setting Up Django 
This project uses the Django framework 
-	First of all the user needs to install Django so in the terminal enter the command –                        pip3 install django
-	Then to create a new project the user needs to type the following command in the terminal  - django-admin startproject ‘insert your project name here’
-	Then the user needs to add a gitignore file in the command line type the following command – touch .gitignore
-	The user will add the following files to the .gitignore file 
    #### o	*.sqlite3
    #### o	*.pyc
    #### o	__pycache__

-	Then the user needs to run the server to see if base project is running by inputting the following in the terminal – python3 manage.py runserver which will open the 8000 port in which the user will be able to view the base project in the browser when they open this port.
-	The user will then need to run the migrate command by inputting the following command in the terminal – python3 manage.py migrate 
-	The user will then have to create a superuser in order to access the admin panel so that they can view the information for the site and make the necessary changes.  To create a superuser in the terminal the user will input – python3 manage.py createsuperusere. 
-	The user will then be prompted to enter a username, email and a password.
-	The user will then make the initial commit to github wit the following commands in the terminal :

## All Auth 
#### To cover user account for example registration and login the user will use Allauth which automatically handles the user account process.   The steps to installing django allauth are in the attached link: 
https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

## Heroku 
#### The user will do the final deployment to Heroku 
#### Login to your account click on the new button and crate new app
#### Choose a name for the app, select the region which is closest to you and click create new app
#### On the resources tab navigate to the Add-ons section and search for Heroku Postgres
#### Select Heroku Postgres then under plan name choose Hoobey Dev free and click submit order form 


#### To use Postgres you will need to install dj_database_url and psycopg2. This should be done in whatever IDE you are using.
#### 1	In your IDE type the command:
pip3 install dj_database_url
#### 2	Then once that is installed type the command:
pip3 install psycopg2-binary
#### 3	Then, to make sure Heroku install all your apps requirements when you deploy it, run the command:
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
#### 4	Next, navigate to your setting.py file in your main project folder. At the top of the file add the line: import dj_database_url
#### 5	Then scroll down the file till you find your database settings. Comment out the default configuration and underneath insert the code:
#### 6	DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse(*Enter Database URL here*)
}
#### 7 The database URL can be found in the settings tab of your app in heroku, under Config Vars. Make sure to have the link in quotation marks
#### 8 If you want to migrate any data from your current database to the Postgres database in Heroku, make sure you run this line before connecting to Postgres:
./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
#### 9 Once that's saved, you will now need to run migrations because you have connected to a new database. This is done by running the command: python3 manage.py migrate If you had previously saved your data to import into the postgres database, you can now run the command:
./manage.py loaddata db.json
#### 10	Now that's setup you will now need to create a superuser for the new database. The command is: python3 manage.py createsuperuser Note, once the superuser is created, it's a good idea to sign into the admin panel, locate the user, and check the option that says their email is verified. This is needed otherwise Allauth won't allow the user to sign into the store.
#### 11 Before you commit these changes, you will need to remove the Databases section in the settings.py and uncomment the original database. This is to stop your Postgres database URL from ending up in version control.
#### 12 Now we can create an if statement in our settings.py to run the postgres database when using the app on heroku or sqlite if not. Scroll back to the database section and refactor the code to look like this: 
	if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
7.	        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
8.	    }
9.	else:
10.	    DATABASES = {
11.	        'default': {
12.	            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
13.	            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
14.	        }
15.	}
